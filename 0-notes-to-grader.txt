I have added a comment before the area that I have changed and marked the beginning of the change and the end.

In the original File the error is at line: 282.

The new section begins in the newly sent MyWebServer.java at line 287.


Following is the comment I added explainin the change which is also in the new MyWebServer.java

            /** IMPORTANT:
             * Beyond this point is the area that had an error.
             * For testing purposes I had hard-coded "html"
             * in the function sendHeader and then changed it.
             * This means that where the function "sendHeader(out,type,filesize)"
             * is I had "sendHeader(out,"html",filesize)".
             * In the file I handed in the if-statement read:
             * 
             * if(type !="html"){
             *      type = "plain";
             * }
             * 
             *  now to ensure that it always works I added an else statement
             *  and now check for the html tag differently to make sure the tag
             *  always is "html" when this is the file-type.
             */

This is the orginal code that was acting up:


            if(type!="html"){
                type = "plain";
            }


This is the new portion replacing the old:


            if(!type.contains("html")){
                type = "plain";
            }
            else{
                type ="html";
            }
